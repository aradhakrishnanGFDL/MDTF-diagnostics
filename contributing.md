## How to contribute to MDTF framework

#### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MDTF-diagnostics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one]([](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MDTF-diagnostics/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If relevant, use the bug report template that appears by default when you open a new issue.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug? 

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [best practices](https://mdtf-diagnostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx/dev_coding_tips.html?highlight=coding) guide to know more about coding conventions. Please note that this is a work in progress to set up best practices.
* Open a new issue to provide suggested changes to the best practices.

#### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of MDTF will still need an issue and go through a review process.

#### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MDTF-diagnostics/discussions) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### Do you have questions about the source code?

* Ask any question about how to use MDTF in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MDTF-diagnostics/discussions).
* Please do check out our [docs](https://mdtf-diagnostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make sure it's not addressed already. But, please know that it's okay to ask us questions! We may redirect you to existing documentations and gather feedback to improve documentation.

#### Do you want to contribute to the MDTF documentation?

* Please start a [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MDTF-diagnostics/discussions). We would love your contribution in any form.

#### Do you have a POD code submission that you'd like to contribute?

* Please double check the [POD development checklist](https://mdtf-diagnostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx/dev_checklist.html?highlight=POD%20%20deve)
* Please check out this [cheatsheet](https://mdtf-diagnostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx/dev_cheatsheet.html?highlight=cheatsheet) and start a PR!
