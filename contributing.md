## How to contribute to MDTF framework

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MDTF-diagnostics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one]([](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MDTF-diagnostics/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If relevant, use the bug report template that appears by default when you open a new issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [best practices](https://mdtf-diagnostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx/dev_coding_tips.html?highlight=coding) guide to know more about coding conventions. Please note that this is a work in progress to set up best practices.
* Open a new issue to provide suggested changes to the best practices.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of MDTF will still need an issue and go through a review process.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MDTF-diagnostics/discussions) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use MDTF in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MDTF-diagnostics/discussions).
* Please do check out our [docs](https://mdtf-diagnostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make sure it's not addressed already. But, please know that it's okay to ask us questions! We may redirect you to existing documentations and gather feedback to improve documentation.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the MDTF documentation?**

* Please start a [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MDTF-diagnostics/discussions). We would love your contribution in any form.

#### ** Do you have a POD code submission that you'd like to contribute?**

* Please double check the [POD development checklist](https://mdtf-diagnostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx/dev_checklist.html?highlight=POD%20%20deve)
* Please check out this [cheatsheet](https://mdtf-diagnostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx/dev_cheatsheet.html?highlight=cheatsheet) and start a PR!
